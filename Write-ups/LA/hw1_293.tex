\section{Setup}
Here, we investigate the treatment effect of offering any sort of ``match'' promise on charitable giving. Specifically, we look at Karlan \& List's 2007 AER paper : ``Does Price Matter in Charitable Giving? Evidence from a Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment'', which randomly selected 2/3 of the population of prior donors of a large charity to recieve one of nine treatments that were a variation of promising to match any donations for a limited time via an outside donor. The control group recieved a similar letter soliciting donations with no promise of a matching donation to theirs. \\ \indent
Our focus is on the average treatment effect (ATE) of promising to match donations on expected dollars donated in response to the solicitation.
